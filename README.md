# API-Task-Board

As a project team member with multiple tasks to organize 
So that a user can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly
A Kanban task board is a visual workflow management tool that helps teams visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can create a dynamic and interactive Kanban board. The HTML structure defines the board with columns for different workflow stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done) and task cards within these columns. CSS is used to style the board, making it visually appealing and user-friendly, with responsive design for different screen sizes. JavaScript adds functionality, such as drag-and-drop capabilities for task cards, dynamic updates, and interaction handling to enhance user experience and streamline task management.
